Hello! My name is **Elena**, and I am a computer graphics enthusiast.

I am currently working as a [**postdoctoral research scientist**](https://medialab.dei.unipd.it/members/elena-camuffo/) at the **University of Padova**, leading research in **Computer Vision**, particularly on **foundational and generative AI** and **3D Gaussian splatting**.
Parallely, I am studying [**3D Technical Art**](portfolio) with [**Houdini**](projects).

### üéì Research & Academic Path

After earning my **M.Sc. in TLC Engineering** in 2021, I did a **Ph.D. in Information Engineering** at the University of Padova, where I focused on **visual representations for scene understanding**.
During my Ph.D., I:

- Published [**over 10 papers**](publications) in international conferences and journals  
(*SIGGRAPH, TOG, TMM, ICASSP, ICIP, IROS*, etc.),
- Spent several months at **Samsung Research UK**, where I co-authored two papers and contributed to a **patent**,
- Supervised young researchers and master students, and supported teaching across several [**Master‚Äôs courses**](teachings),
- Contributed to applied [projects](projects) in **XR**, **education**, and **interdisciplinary research**.

### üé® Creative Technology & Digital Arts

Alongside my academic work, I‚Äôve always been drawn to the **creative side of technology**.  
In 2024, I attended the [**BigRock Master in Computer Graphics**](portfolio), where I honed my artistic skills in **digital art**, **real-time rendering**, and **storytelling**, using tools like **Maya**, **ZBrush**, and **Unreal Engine**.

### üöÄ Vision & Future Goals

I see myself at the intersection of **research**, **creative technologies**, and **education**.  
I‚Äôm passionate about blending the precision of mathematics with the creativity of digital arts. 
My goal is to develop systems that not only **perceive and interact** with the world but also enable **intuitive and expressive experiences**, making advanced technologies more approachable and impactful. I‚Äôm especially interested in projects that combine **AI**, **vision**, and **graphics** whether in **academia**, **R&D**, or the **creative industry**.
